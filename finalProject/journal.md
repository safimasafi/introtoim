* In Arduino, we learned about (or we will this week):
    * Analog Input, Analog Output, Digital Input, Digital Output, Servo motor, Tone, DC motor, LCD, Ultrasonic distance measuring sensor
* In Processing, we learned about (or we will this week):
    * Drawing with primitives, Transformations, Images, Animation, Sprites, Sound, Text, Files

* Your final project must incorporate at least 4 items from Arduino and Processing and some form of communication between the two. Start with a preliminary description of what you intend for your project. Include hand sketches as necessary to illustrate your concept.

Project idea: it's a secret
