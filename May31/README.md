It took me a while to get used to aligning shapes by their correct proportions along the axes. I started the assignment a day ago and the portrait looked more than an alien figure (nothing against aliens though, we come in peace!) and the lesson today made it more human-like. Perhaps the hardest part was figuring out the traingle allignment for the nose; after that, getting the mouth done was easier. It also took me a while to figure out that after writing a noStokre attribte, the line shape won't show up unless I change the stroke colour. I did enjoy playing around with the RGB colour selector a little.
It would be cool to make a sketch that's responsive to a real-time cam portrait of myself!
