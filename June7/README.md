This homework was inspired by this Painting with Pixels tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbX3RnlAyGU), and my longing to return to Berlin and its vibrant club scene, dark skies, and rainy nights.

I thought it was interesting to leave the image displayed as is, and have a shape filled with colours from the image pixels fill up the canvas at random locations until the entire image is covered. I like the effect of the image in the end and it really, at least to me, looks like rain.

I also tried out the same thing but with the tint function, applying a bit of transparency but not changing the colour. That part of the code was commented out as I wanted the main part to be the 'rainy' effect.
````
//image(img, 0, 0); //'rainy' effect
  tint(220, 126);
  image(img, 0, 0); //'pointalism' effect over tinted image *comment out ^image*
````
