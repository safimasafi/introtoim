For this assignment, I wanted to continue working with the rectangle shape and tried out making a fading trail effect, and added an ellipse to have the rotating rectangles contained within a shape rather than an empty canvas. 
Iâ€™m still trying to understand the role of classes; I used the float function as a standalone rather than having a set of variables contained within a class.
