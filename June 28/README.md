HW 10 - Communicating with Arduino and Processing

V.1

For this HW I built off the communication with Arduino from my mid-term game.

This time, instead of the red circle being controlled by the mouse, I let it be controlled by a potentiometer. 
The main code that was added in Processing, aside from declaring the float, creating object from Serial class, and changing if statements on void gameover was:â€¨
````
if (myPort.available() > 0) {
    value = myPort.read();
    println(value); 
    m = map(value, 0, 255, 0, height);  //maps values from 0-255 to canvas height
  }
````
I first put the code in void draw function but later realized it should go in void game function where the red ellipse was under. With the help of the [map reference page](https://processing.org/reference/map_.html), I was able to correctly map the ellipse to move at the target range of the canvas/game.
