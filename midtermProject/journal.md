"Start with a preliminary description of what you intend for your project, followed by a journal of your progress. Each day add the date and then describe the work you plan to do or did that day. Include you thoughts, decisions, experiments, etc. Discuss what worked and what didn't. At the end of each journal entry, describe whether, and if so, how, the results of today's work has caused you to modify your plan for your midterm project. As always, pictures, hand drawn sketches, pieces of code, etc. can all be used to make your journal interesting and informative."


June 7: I pretty much spent the whole day looking through almost every example in the Minim library and playing around with them, ideally to *get inspiration*. I was impressed at the range of synthesis examples in the library and thought that my main idea could be a piano tiles sort of game, or a one and a half octave piano player with some effects knobs for basic synthesis implementation. At the same time, after some thinking, I realised that replicating piano sounds (C3-C4) on a virtual environment isn’t al that interesting and didn’t see the point of such replication.  I thought I could instead have an audio map with sound/field recordings, or create a player that would take sound files and play them at random, to create a ‘composition’ that would be represented visually, like a sound palette.
