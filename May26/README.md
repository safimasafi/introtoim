It took me a while to get used to aligning shapes by their correct proportions along the axes. I started the assignment a day ago and out lesson today helped making the portrait look more than an alien-like figure (nothing against aliens though, we come in peace!) Perhaps the hardest part was figuring out the traingle allignment for the nose; after that, getting the mouth done was easier. It also took me a while to figure out that after writing a noStokre attribte, the line shape won't show up unless I change the stroke colour. I did enjoy playing around with the RGB colour selector a little.
