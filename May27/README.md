I had to re-watch some videos on the weekly schedule about 'int' values and that took some time getting started with the actual HW. After many fails in getting things to work, I decided to just go along with a simple vertex shape and I was interested in making it somewhat reactive to mouse movement, so I searched up how to can make that happen and implemeneted it in the code. I also saw that there's a P3D mode that can create a 3D illusion in Processing, maybe that's something to try in future works.
